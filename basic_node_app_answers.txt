1. What is a Node module?

It holds functions you can use in your application.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

module.exports is an object that require() returns whereas exports is just a
reference to that object.

3. Why is using exports recommended?

So you don't overwrite the original default object.  If you do, you can no longer
access the original methods you defined on that object.
